**1.** **Introduction**
**1.1 Background**
IIT Delhi offers various Undergraduate, Post Graduduate and Ph.D. Programms at the undergraduate level, IIT
Delhi provides science-based engineering education with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. Every
B.Tech. student needs to do compulsory foundation courses in the areas of basic sciences, humanities, social
sciences and engineering sciences apart from departmental requirements in his/her core engineering discipline.
Departmental courses (core and electives) constitute about half of the total curriculum. Further, students do
open category electives to develop broad inter-disciplinary knowledge base or to specialize significantly in
an area outside the parent discipline. Many activities are included in the undergraduate curriculum as nongraded core with a view to enhance the quality of learning. The curriculum provides broad based knowledge
and simultaneously builds a temper for a lifelong process of learning and exploring. At present, IIT Delhi offers
14 B.Tech., 3 Dual Degree (integrated B.Tech. and M.Tech.), and 1 B.Des. programmes.
IIT Delhi also offers multiple Postgraduate Programmes (M.Sc./M.Tech./M.S.(Research)/M.Des./M.B.A./M.P.P./M.A./
Ph.D.) through its Departments, Centres, and Schools. Currently, there are 37 M.Tech., 8 Interdisciplinary M.Tech., 18
M.S.(R.), 6 M.Sc., 1 M.Des., 3 M.B.A. (including part time), 1 M.P.P., 1 PG Diploma, and 31 Ph.D. programmes offered
by different academic units. In addition, there are 2 joint Ph.D. and 1 joint PG Diploma programmes being offered in
collaboration with partner institutions. The Institute has multiple courses at appropriate levels to cater to the academic
requirements of the Postgraduate students. New courses are also being continuously added to the existing pool of PG and
Pre-Ph.D. courses. At the postgraduate level, students are also encouraged to look beyond their area of specialization
to broaden their horizons through open electives and self-learning.
The medium of instruction in the Institute is English.
The Institute follows a semester system. An academic year typically runs from July through June next year and is
essentially comprised of two semesters. Typically, the 1 [st] semester starts in the last week of July and ends in the 1 [st]
week of December; the 2 [nd] semester starts in the 1 [st] week of January and ends in the 2 [nd] week of May. Additionally, the
summer semester which starts in the 3 [rd] week of May and ends in the 2 [nd] week of July, is utilized in some exceptional
cases. Detailed schedule is given in the Semester Schedule that is made available before the start of each semester.
**1.2 Departments, Centres and Schools**
Each course is offered by an Academic Unit which could be a Department, a Centre or a School. The names of
Departments, Centres and Schools and their two-letter codes are given in Table 1. Some programmes are offered
jointly by multiple academic units and are classified as interdisciplinary programmes; their codes are given in Table 2.

listed in item ‘D’ and ‘G’ above. It is awarded only to those students who have not been able to complete the
requirements of the corresponding M.Tech. degree. For details please see PG Programme Rules, Section 1.6.
_**L.**_ _**Doctor of Philosophy: (Ph.D.)**_
All departments, centres and schools listed in Section 1.2 offer Ph.D. programmes. In addition, two joint
Ph.D. programmes are offered in association with The University of Queensland Australia and National Yang
Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. The two-letter code of the academic unit followed by ‘Z’ corresponds to
the Ph.D. code of the respective academic unit. (e.g. MAZ is the Ph.D. code of the Mathematics Department).
**1.4 Entry Number**
The entry number of a student consists of eleven alpha-numerals, as described below:
**2** **0** **2** **2** **A** **B** **C** **6** **7** **8** **9**
11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
In case of change in Programme by a student, the programme code in his/her entry number (fields 5, 6 and
7) will be changed. However, his / her unique identification number will remain unchanged. Such students will
have two entry numbers, one prior to programme change and one after the change. However, any time, only
one entry number, that corresponds to the student’s present status will be valid and active.
**1.5 Honour Code**
The Honour Code of IIT Delhi is given at the end of this document. Every student signs this Honour Code at
the time of admission and is expected to adhere to the Honour Code throughout the period of his/her studies
at the Institute.

**2.** **COURSE STRUCTURE AND credit SYSTEM**
**2.1 Course Numbering Scheme**
Normally every course at IIT Delhi runs for the full length of the semester. Only exception is for V-type courses which
may run for part of the semester. A student registers in advance for courses that he/she wants to study and at the
end of the semester a grade is awarded. On obtaining a pass grade, the student earns all the credits associated
with the course while a fail grade does not get any credit. Partial credits are not awarded.
Each course is denoted by a unique code consisting of three alphabets followed by three numerals:
#### **`E L L 1 0 0`**
|1 0 0|Col2|
|---|---|
|Level of the course as determined by<br>pre-requisite courses or number of earned<br>credits.<br><br>Unique identifcation<br>number for each course<br>}|Level of the course as determined by<br>pre-requisite courses or number of earned<br>credits.<br><br>Unique identifcation<br>number for each course<br>}|

|**D**|Project based courses (e.g. Major, Minor, Mini Projects)|
|**L**|Lecture courses<br>(other than lecture hours, these courses can have Tutorial and Practical hours, e.g. L-T-P<br>structures 3-0-0, 3-1-2, 3-0-2, 2-0-0, etc.)|
|**N**|Non-graded core component|
|**P**|Practical/Practice based courses<br>(where performance is evaluated primarily on the basis of practice, practical or laboratory<br>work with LTP structures such as 0-0-3, 0-0-4, 1-0-3, 0-1-3, etc.)|
|**Q**|Seminar Courses|
|**R**|Professional Practices|
|**S**|Independent Study|
|**T**|Practical Training|
|**V**|Lecture Courses on Special Topics (1 or 2 credits)|
_**(b)**_ _**Level of the course**_
The first digit of the numeric part of the course code indicates the level of the course as determined by pre-requisite
course(s) and/or by the maturity required for registering for the course. The latter requirement is enforced through
a requirement of minimum number of earned credits. In general,
100 – 400 level courses : Core and elective courses for UG programmes.
These courses are not open to any PG student.
7
Courses of Study 2024-2025 **common rules**
500 level courses : Courses for M.Sc. programmes.
These courses are not open to other students.
600 level courses : Preparatory/introductory courses for M.Tech. and advanced courses for M.Sc.
programmes. 500 and 600 level courses are normally not open to UG students.
700 - 800 level courses : Core and elective courses for M.Tech., M.Des., M.B.A., M.S.(Research) and Ph.D.
programmes. Usually 800 level courses are advanced courses for PG students.
**2.2 Credit System**
Education at the Institute is organized around the semester-based credit system of study. A student is allowed to
attend classes in a course and earn credit for it, only if he/she has registered for that course. Prominent features
of the credit system are a process of continuous evaluation of a student’s performance/progress and flexibility to
allow a student to progress at an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum
requirements for continuation and within the maximum allowable period for completion of a degree.
A student’s performance/progress is measured by the number of credits that he/she has earned, i.e. completed
satisfactorily. Based on the course credits and grades obtained by the student, grade point average is calculated. A
minimum grade point average is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme.
Also, a minimum number of earned credits and a minimum grade point average should be acquired in order to qualify
for the degree. All programmes are defined by the total credit requirement and a pattern of credit distribution over
courses of different categories as defined in sections 4 and 5 for UG and PG programmes respectively.
**2.3 Assignment of Credits to Courses**
Each course has a certain number of credit(s) or non-graded unit(s) assigned to it depending upon its lecture, tutorial
and laboratory/practical contact hours in a week. This weightage is also indicative of the academic expectation that
includes in-class contact and self-study outside class hours.
_Lectures and Tutorials_ : One lecture or tutorial hour per week over the period of one 14 week semester is
assigned one credit.
_Practical/Practice_ : One laboratory/practice hour per week over the period of one 14 week semester is
assigned half credit.
A few courses are without credit and are counted under non-graded (NG) courses.
**Example :** Course _COL334 Computer Networks_ ; 4 credits (3-0-2)
The credits indicated for this course are computed as follows:
3 hours/week lectures = 3 credits
0 hours/week tutorial = 0 credit Total = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4 credits
2 hours/week practicals = 2 × 0.5 = 1 credit
Total contact hours for the course = ( **3** h Lectures + **0** h Tutorial + **2** h Practical) per week
= **5** contact hours per week for 14 weeks.
For each lecture or tutorial credit, the self-study component is 1-2 hours/week (for 100-600 level courses) and 3
hours/week (for 700-800 level courses). The self-study component for practicals is 1 hour for every two hours of
practicals per week. In the above example, the student is expected to devote a minimum of 3 + 1 = 4 hours per
week on self-study in addition to class contact of 5 hours per week.
**2.4 Earning Credits**
At the end of every semester, a letter grade is awarded in each course for which a student had registered. On
obtaining a pass grade, the student accumulates the course credits as earned credits. An undergraduate student
has the option of auditing some courses within the credit requirements for graduation. Grades obtained in audit
courses are not counted for computing of grade point average. However, a pass grade is essential for earning
credits from an audit course. Section 2.9 defines the letter grades awarded at IIT Delhi and specifies the minimum
grade for passing a course.

**2.6 Pre-requisite(s)**
Each course, other than 100 level courses, may have specified pre-requisite(s) which may be other course(s), or
a minimum number of earned credits, or both. A student who has not obtained a pass grade in the pre-requisite(s)
specified or has not earned requisite number of credits will not be eligible to register for that course. For example:
**TXL372 Speciality Yarns and Fabrics**
2 Credits (2-0-0)
Pre-requisite(s): TXL222 and TXL232
A student who has obtained a pass grade in TXL222 and TXL232 will be eligible to register for this course.
For UG students, the Pre-requisite(s) for some courses of special nature are given below.
Independent Study 65 earned credits
Mini Project 65 earned credits
Minor Project (Dual Degree) 100 earned credits
B.Tech. Project Part - I 100 earned credits
B.Tech. Project Part - II Minimum B Grade in B.Tech. Project Part - I
M.Tech. Major Project Part-I (Dual Degree) 135 earned credits
In addition to any pre-requisite specified for 700 and 800 level courses, a UG student needs to earn 75 and 100
credits to register for 700 and 800 level courses, respectively.
**2.7 Overlapping/Equivalent Courses**
Wherever applicable, overlapping and equivalent courses have been identified for each course. A student is not
permitted to earn credits by registering for more than one course in a set of overlapping / equivalent courses.
Departments / Centres / Schools may use these overlapping/equivalent courses for meeting degree / pre-requisite
requirements in special circumstances. For example:
**CLL113 Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering**
4 Credits (3-0-2)
Overlaps with: MTL107, MTP290, MTL445, CVL734, COL726
A student who has earned a pass grade in CLL113 will not be eligible to register for MTL107, MTP290,
MTL445, CVL734 or COL726. An overlapping course cannot serve as a substitute for a core course of
his / her programme. In the above example, if MTL107 is a core course for a student, he / she is not
allowed to register for CLL113 as a substitute for this core course.

Courses of Study 2024-2025 **common rules**
**2.8 Course Coordinator**
Every course is usually coordinated by a member of the teaching staff of a Department/Centre/School in a given
semester. This faculty member is designated as the Course Coordinator. He/she has the full responsibility for
conducting the course, coordinating the work of other members of the faculty and teaching assistants involved
in that course, administering assignments, conducting the tests as well as moderating and awarding the grades.
For any difficulty related to a course, the student is expected to approach the respective course coordinator
for advice and clarification. The distribution of the weightage for tests, quizzes, assignments, laboratory work,
workshop and drawing assignment, term paper, etc. that will be the basis for award of grade in a course will be
decided by the course coordinator of that course, in consultation with other teachers involved, and announced
at the beginning of the semester.
**2.9 Grading System**
The grade obtained in a course reflects a student’s performance in the course. While relative standing of the
student is indicated by his/her grades, the process of awarding grades is not necessarily based upon fitting the
marks scored by the students to some statistical distribution. The course coordinator and associated faculty for
a course formulate appropriate procedure to award grades that are reflective of the student’s performance visà-vis the expected learning outcomes of the course.
**2.9.1** **Grade points**
The grades and their equivalent numerical points (referred to as Grade Points) are listed in Table 3.
_**Table 3: Grades and their description.**_
|Grade|Grade points|Description|
|---|---|---|
|A|1 0|Outstanding|
|A (-)|9|Excellent|
|B|8|Very good|
|B (-)|7|Good|
|C|6|Average|

|U|-|Unsatisfactory progress in Ph.D.|
**2.9.2** **Description of grades**
**A** grade
An ‘A’ grade stands for outstanding achievement. The minimum marks for award of an ‘A’ grade is 80 %. However,
individual course coordinators may set a higher marks requirement for awarding an ‘A’ grade.
10
**common rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025
**C** grade
The ‘C’ grade stands for average performance. This is the minimum grade required to pass in the Major Project
Part 1 and Part 2 of Dual degree and 2 year M.Tech. and M.S.(R) Programmes.
**D** grade
The ‘D’ grade stands for marginal performance; i.e. it is the minimum passing grade in any course excluding the
M.Tech. Major Project. The minimum marks for award of ‘D’ grade is 30 %. However, individual course coordinators
may set a higher marks requirement.
**E** and **F** grades
A student who has scored at least 20% aggregate marks in a subject can be awarded an ‘E’ Grade. The Course
Coordinators are, however, free to enhance this limit but should keep the percentage about 10% less than the
cut-off marks for ‘D’ Grade. The Course Coordinators can also specify any additional requirements (to be specified
at the beginning of the Semester) for awarding ‘E’ Grade. Students who obtain an ‘E’ Grade will be eligible to
appear in a repeat major test (re-major test), an examination with weightage same as that of Major test, for only
lecture courses (‘L’ Category Courses described in section 2.1). If they perform satisfactorily, they become eligible
for getting the grade converted to a ‘D’ Grade, otherwise they will continue to have ‘E’ Grade. The student will
have only one chance to appear for re-major for an ‘E’ Grade. The re-major test will be conducted within the first
week of the next semester. The date of re-major test of Institute core courses for undergraduate students will be
centrally notified, while for all other courses, the date would be announced by the respective course coordinators.
A student can appear for a maximum of three such re-major tests in a given semester. If a student cannot appear
for the re-major test due to any reason(s), he/she will not get any additional chance.
If a student with ‘E’ grade in a course does not pass the course through a re-major test or obtains an ‘F’ grade in
the course, he/she has to repeat the course if it is a core course. In case the course is an elective, the student
may take the same course again or any other course from the same category. ‘E’ and ‘F’ Grades are not counted
in the calculation of the CGPA; however, these are taken into account in the calculation of the SGPA. (Please see
2.10 for definitions)
**I** grade
An ‘I’ grade is temporarily awarded to a student on his/her request to denote incomplete performance in L (lecture),
P (practical), V (special module) category courses. Requests for ‘I’ grade should be made at the earliest but not
later than the last day of major tests. An ‘I’ grade is awarded in case of absence on medical grounds or other
special circumstances, before or during the major examination period, provided the student has met the attendance
criterion of the course. Attendance in the course for which ‘I’ grade is being sought will be certified by the course
coordinator of the course.
The course coordinators can instruct all students awarded ‘I’ grade as well as ‘E’ grade to appear for a common
re-major test. All evaluation requirements for such students in the corresponding course(s) should be completed
before the end of the first week of the next semester. Upon completion of all course requirements, the ‘I’ grade is
converted to a regular grade (A to F, NP or NF).
**NP** and **NF** grades
These grades are awarded in a course that the student opts to audit. Only elective courses can be audited. Auditing
a course is allowed until a date stipulated in the semester schedule. The audit pass (NP) grade is awarded if the
student’s attendance is above 75% in the class and he/she has obtained at least ‘D’ grade. The course coordinator
can specify a higher criterion, at the beginning of the semester, for audit pass. If the stipulated requirements are
not fulfilled, the audit fail (NF) grade is awarded. The grades obtained in an audit course are not considered in the
calculation of SGPA, CGPA or DGPA. However, for undergraduate students, the credits will be counted in total
earned credits in the respective category, subject to the maximum allowable limit for audit.
**W** grade
A ‘W’ grade is awarded in a course from which the student has opted to withdraw. Withdrawal from a course is
permitted until the date specified in the Semester Schedule. Withdrawal from PG major project part 2 is allowed
only if he/she is given semester withdrawal. The W grade is mentioned on the grade card.
11
Courses of Study 2024-2025 **common rules**
**X** grade
The ‘X’ grade is awarded for incomplete work in Independent Study, Mini Project, Minor Project, or Major Project
Part-1 and Part-2, based on the request of the student. On completion of the work, ‘X’ grade can be converted to
a regular grade within the first week of the next semester. Otherwise, the student will be awarded ‘X’ grade on a
permanent basis and it will appear in his / her grade card. Further, the student will be required to register for the
course in the next semester. The credits of the course will be counted towards his / her total load for the semester.
In case of Major Project Part-1, the student will not be permitted to register for Major Project Part 2 simultaneously
as Major Project Part-1 is a pre-requisite for Major Project Part-2. A regular full-time student can be awarded ‘X’
grade only once in a course, other than the summer semester. A part-time M.Tech. student is permitted a maximum
of two X-grades in the Major Project Part-2.
**S** and **Z** grades
The ‘S’ grade denotes satisfactory performance and completion of a course. The ‘Z’ grade is awarded for noncompletion of the course requirements, and if it is a core course, the student will have to register for the course
until he/she obtains the ‘S’ grade. The specific courses in which ‘S’ or ‘Z’ grades are awarded for undergraduate
students are:
(i) Introduction to Engineering and Programme
(ii) Language and Writing skills
(iii) NCC / NSO OOo / NSS
(iv) Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility
(v) Communication Skills / Seminar
(vi) Design / Practical Experience
Besides, summer / winter internships in some PG programmes are also awarded S / Z.
**2.10 Evaluation of Performance**
The performance of a student will be evaluated in terms of three indices, viz., the Semester Grade Point Average
(SGPA) which is the Grade Point Average for a semester, Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) which is the
Grade Point Average for all the completed semesters at any point in time, and Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA).
Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA) is calculated on the basis of the best valid credits in each category, after
graduation requirements in all categories are met.
The Earned Credits (E.C.) are defined as the sum of credits for courses in which a student has been awarded pass
grades. Points secured in a semester =Σ (Course credits × Grade point for all courses in which pass grade has
been obtained). The SGPA is calculated on the basis of grades obtained in all courses the student registered for,
in the particular semester, except audit courses.
_Points secured in the semester_
SGPA =
_Credits registered in the semester, excluding audit and S/Z grade courses_
The CGPA is calculated on the basis of pass grades obtained in all completed semesters, except audit courses
and courses in which S/Z grade is awarded.
CGPA =
_Cumulative points secured in courses with pass grades_
_Cumulative earned credits, excluding audit and S/Z grade courses_
Examples of these calculations are given in Tables 4(a) and 4 (b).

**3.** **REGISTRATION AND attendance**
**3.1 Registration**
Registration is a very important procedural part of the academic system. The registration procedure ensures that
the student’s name is on the roll list of each course that he/she wants to study. **No credit is given if the student**
**attends a course for which he/she has not registered.** Registration for courses to be taken in a particular
semester will be done according to a specified schedule before the end of the previous semester. Each student
is required to complete the registration process on the web-based system. The student must also take steps to
pay his/her dues before the beginning of the semester. Students who do not make payments by a stipulated date
can be de-registered for the particular semester.
Students have to report on the date prescribed by office of Dean Academics to mark his/her attendance in person,
before the start of Semester. This is a requirement for validation of registration of existing students.
In-absentia registration or registration after the specified date will be allowed only in rare cases at the discretion
of Dean, Academics. In case of illness or absence during registration, the student should intimate the same to
his/her Programme Coordinator and Dean, Academics.
Brief description of registration related activities is given in the following paragraphs. The relevant dates are
included in the Semester Schedule that is made available before the start of the semester. There may be changes
in the schedule and/or procedure of registration from time to time. The students are intimated through e-mail about
any such change to the e-mail address allocated to each student by the Institute at the time of admission. **This**
**e-mail address is the only channel through which the Institute would communicate with the student. For**
**cyber security reasons, e-mail accounts / kerberos logins that are not used for a certain length of time are**
**disabled and such accounts locked / deleted by the Institute. Students must therefore login into their e-mail**
**accounts / kerberos logins regularly.**
**3.2 Registration and Student Status**
Failure to register before the last date for late registration will imply that the student has discontinued studies and
his / her name will be struck off the rolls.
All registered students, except part-time postgraduate students and visiting students, are considered as full-time
students at the Institute. They are expected to be present at the Institute and devote full time to academics and
co-curricular and extra-curricular activities in the campus.
**3.3 Advice on Courses**
At the time of registration, each student must finalize the academic programme, keeping in view factors such as,
minimum / maximum numbers of total and lecture credits, past performance, backlog of courses, SGPA / CGPA,
pre-requisite(s), work-load and student’s interests, amongst others. Special provisions exist for advising academically
weak students. Details are given in UG Programme Rules, Section 1.7.
**3.4 Validation of Registration**
Before the commencement of classes of each semester, on a date specified in the Semester Schedule, every
student including part-time students, is required to be present on campus and validate his / her registration by
logging into the website. Students who do not do registration validation will not be permitted to add / drop courses.
**3.5 Minimum Student Registration in a Course**
Undergraduate courses (of 100, 200, 300, or 400 level) and M.Sc. courses (500 or 600 level) will run if a minimum
of 12 students register for the course. Under special circumstances, a departmental elective course may be
allowed to run with minimum registration of 8 students, with prior permission of Chairperson, Senate. A 700 or 800
level course can run with a minimum of 4 students. This requirement will be verified on the last date for Add / Drop.
Courses without the minimum enrolment will be dropped. The students who had registered for these courses will
be de-registered, and they will be given one more day for adding a course in lieu of the dropped course.
**3.6 Late Registration**
For reasons beyond his / her control, if a student is not able to register or send an authorized representative
with a medical certificate, he / she may apply to the Dean, Academics for late registration. Dean, Academics will
15
Courses of Study 2024-2025 **common rules**
consider and may approve late registration in genuine cases on payment of an extra fee called late registration
fee. Late registration is permitted until a date specified in the Semester Schedule, typically one week after the
beginning of the semester.
**3.7 Add/Drop, Audit and Withdrawal of Courses**
a) **Add / Drop:** A student has the option to add courses that he / she has not registered for or drop courses
for which he/she has already registered for. This facility is restricted to a period stipulated in the Semester
Schedule, during the first week of the semester, subject to vacancy status of the courses concerned.
b) **Audit:** A student may apply for changing a credit course to an audit course before a deadline specified in
the Semester Schedule.
c) **Withdrawal:** A student who wants to withdraw from a course should apply before a deadline specified in the
Semester Schedule. A withdrawal grade (W) will be awarded in such cases.
Appropriate web-based applications are to be used for availing of the above-mentioned options.
**3.8 Semester Withdrawal**
Semester withdrawal and absence for a semester under different conditions, _viz_ . (i) medical and personal
grounds (ii) industrial internship (iii) exchange / deputation to another academic institution in India or abroad,
and (iv) disciplinary condition can be granted on application. The condition as per the following should be clearly
specified in the application.
(a) Semester Withdrawal (SW) reflects the condition, in which a student is forced to withdraw from all courses in
the semester for medical conditions, or for a part-time student when he / she is sent for an outstation assignment
by his / her employer. A student can apply for semester withdrawal if he / she has missed 20 or more teaching
days on these grounds. Under no circumstances will an application for semester withdrawal be accepted
after the commencement of major tests. A student is not permitted to request for semester withdrawal with
retrospective effect.
(b) Semester Leave (SL) indicates the situation in which a student is permitted to take one or more semesters off
for industrial internship or any other assignment with prior approval and planning. The application is to be routed
through his / her advisor / programme coordinator and Head of the concerned Department / Centre / School.
Dean, Academics is the final approving authority for such requests. All such applications must be processed
before the beginning of the semester in which the leave will be taken. At present, UG students are allowed
one extra semester for completion of the programme for every semester leave for industrial internship. Such
students are permitted a maximum of two semesters of leave. The full-time 2 year M.Tech. / M.S.(R) students
would be permitted a maximum of one semester leave for industrial internship or other assignment as approved
by the Dean. These semesters will not be counted towards the maximum permitted time period for completion
of the degree similar to the provision for UG students.
(c) When a student registers at another academic institution in India or abroad with the expectation of credit
transfer or research work through a pre-approved arrangement including an MoU, the student should be
considered as being on a Semester Exchange (SE). The SE period will be counted towards the total period
permitted for the degree.
(d) When a student is suspended for one or more semesters on disciplinary grounds, the student status should
be called Disciplinary Withdrawal period (DW).
(e) UG student may go for a long Internship or spend a semester on a Technical Start-up with the prior approval
of the DPE Committee of the Department.
**3.9 Registration in Special Module Courses**
Special module courses, i.e. ‘V’-category courses, are 1 or 2 credit courses that can be offered at the beginning
of the semester and the regular registration procedure will be followed. A ‘V’-category course may also be
offered during the semester. In such a case, students will be allowed to add this course before classes for the
course begin. These courses will usually cover specialized topics that are not generally available in the regular
courses. Eligible students can register for these courses. The course coordinator will evaluate the students’
performance and award a letter grade. The credits so earned will count towards the appropriate category for
degree completion purposes.

**common rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025
**3.10 Registration for Non-graded Units**
Details pertaining to registration and other modalities of earning non-graded units are given in UG Programme
Rules, Section 4.
**3.11 Pre-requisite Requirement(s) for Registration**
A student can register for a course only if he/she fulfills the pre-requisite requirement(s). Request for relaxation
of pre-requisite requirement(s) may be raised by students under special circumstances. Such a request needs
approval of the Departmental Faculty Advisor and Chairperson Grades and Registration.
**3.12 Overlapping/Equivalent Courses**
A student is not allowed to earn credits from two overlapping/equivalent courses. Overlapping/equivalent courses,
wherever applicable, are specified in the Description of Course Contents.
**3.13 Limits on Registration**
An undergraduate student should register for a minimum of 12 credits in a semester. The number of credits a UG
student can register in a semester will be limited to 24 for the first 5 semesters with a provision to allow registration
upto 26 credits for upto 2 semesters during the entire period of study. A student on probation can register upto
18 credits in a semester. This can be relaxed in 8th / 10th or later registered semester for B.Tech. /Dual Degree
students, respectively.
**3.14 Registration and Fee Payment**
Every registered student must pay the stipulated fees in full before the specified deadlines. In the event that a
student does not make these payments, he/she can be de-registered from all courses and his/her name can be
struck off from the rolls.
**3.15 Continuous Absence and Registration Status**
If a student is absent from the Institute for more than four weeks without notifying the Head of Department /
Centre / School or Dean, Academics, his / her registration will be terminated and name will be removed from the
Institute rolls.
**3.16 Attendance Rule**
It is mandatory for the students to attend all classes. Attendance Records of all students for each course will be
maintained.
The Course Coordinator will announce the class policy on attendance with respect to grading etc., at the beginning
of the semester. This shall be done keeping in mind the importance of classroom learning in the teaching-learning
process. Once the class attendance policy has been made clear to all the students registered for the course, the
Course Coordinator will implement the same in totality.
For the purpose of attendance calculation, every scheduled practical class will count as one unit irrespective of
the number of contact hours.
Attendance record will be maintained based upon roll calls (or any equivalent operation) in every scheduled lecture,
tutorial and practical class. Students are required to strictly adhere to and comply with any method or device
employed by the Course Coordinator / Instructor for purpose of Attendance Recording. Failure to do so may call for
disciplinary action. The course coordinator will maintain and consolidate attendance record for the course (lectures,
tutorials and practicals together, as applicable).
A Course Coordinator may choose any one or more of the following as attendance policy.
(a) The Course Coordinator can assign 10% of the total marks to surprise quiz(zes). If attendance of
the student is greater than 90%, result of the best three quizzes will be considered, else average
of all quizzes will be considered.
(b) The Course Coordinator can allocate specific marks for participation in discussions in the class on
a regular basis.
17
Courses of Study 2024-2025 **common rules**
(c) If a student’s attendance is less than 75%, the student will be awarded one grade less than the actual
grade that he/she has earned. For example, a student who has got an A grade but has attendance less
than 75% will be awarded an A (-) grade.
(d) A student cannot get NP for an audit course if his/her attendance is less than 75%.
The Course Coordinator can implement any other attendance policy provided the policy is approved by the Dean,
Academics.
Attendance statistics will also be used in the following way:
(a) If a student’s attendance is less than 75% in more than two courses without any valid reason in a
semester, he/she will be issued warning and put under probation. If this is repeated, he/she will not be
allotted a hostel seat in the next semester.
(b) If a student’s attendance is less than 75% in any course or CGPA is less than 7.0, then he/she will not
be eligible to hold any position of responsibility in the hostel/institute in the next semester.
